# 🖥️ AIO PC Setup Assistant

A fully automated PowerShell-based setup assistant for fresh Windows installs. This tool helps you:

- ✅ Install essential and developer software
- 🧹 Remove bloatware and unwanted apps
- 🛠 Apply system tweaks (like moving Downloads, enabling Hibernate, etc.)

---

## 🚀 One-Line Setup

To run everything in one go, open PowerShell **as Administrator** and paste:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motsmanish/aio-pc-setup-assistant/main/setup.ps1")))
```

> 🟡 This will:
> 1. Download the `setup.ps1` from GitHub
> 2. Dynamically fetch and run additional modules (`tweaks`, `install-software`, `remove-bloatware`)
> 3. Guide you through an interactive PC setup process
